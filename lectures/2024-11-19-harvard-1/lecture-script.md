Transforming Blockchain with AI: Andromeda’s Next Frontier 
Introduction (5 minutes)
	1.	Welcome & Speaker Introduction: Myron Koch, Head of AI and AI UX
	•	Began in the entertainment industry in the 90s, first to figure out digital ticketing in my region. 
	•	Profited from that for many years, as that parlayed into building corporate and larger entertainment websites. Learned new languages, frameworks, operating systems through that. 
	•	Became part of a red teaming community that tested the integrity of iphone apps on the iPhone 3G (~2008), and continued through several other iphone releases
	•	Saw Ray Kurzweil speak in Nov 2012 on his “How to Create a Mind” book tour, where 
	•	Kurzweil discussed pattern recognition as a framework for thought…
	•	first time I got wind of the idea of neural networks, AGI, & Artificial Gen Intel).  
	•	He said point blank that (neural networks) could and would produce an artificial intelligence more capable than the human brain.
	•	School of Blind president story
	•	Invented Flatbed scanner, OCR, and the first synthesized voice
	•	Stevie Wonder became friends w/ him, bet him that he couldn’t make that sound like an organ, Rhodes, piano, or synth….. 
	•	Kurzweil also said all of the pieces “currently (then) existed to develop injectable, wi-fi enabled nanobots that could mimic cell types, so if you needed extra neocortex cells to do a human-brain-power-bottlenecked process, the nanobots would mimic extra neurons…or if you needed extra muscle, they could receive the order thru wifi, then mimic the actin-myosin muscle structure and action. 
	•	That blasted me off, and I kept abreast of the latest research as much as possible,  From 2012 through 2020...  
	•	Computer Vision (AlexNet, ResNet, GANs, Vision Transformers)
	•	Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Word2Vec, BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3, ChatGPT)
	•	Generative Models (GANs, DALL·E)
	•	Reinforcement Learning (AlphaGo)
	•	Cross-Modal AI (Vision and Language integration, e.g., DALL·E)
	•	Scientific Applications (AlphaFold for biology and protein folding)
	•	
	•	NOW - allowed into chatGPT’s public beta release on day 3, was doing battery systems research, so had a mound of technical information to churn. Learned the abilities of AI to turn hours of work into minutes. From that point on, tried to find ways to push the envelope. 
	•	Anthropic Claude
	•	Amazon investment, now is rufus, will replace Alexa
	•	Introduced “artifacts” (side code w 			


	2.	Session Overview: Outline what attendees will learn:
	•	How AI complements blockchain
	POSSIBILITIES - What we see starting to emerge in the AI / Blockchain community


	•	Andromeda’s AI-powered innovations
	•	Androptimus - a fine-tuned Google Gemini model that we at Andromeda use internally for a wide variety of tasks. 
	•	Create concise documentation by dropping a codebase into the bot 
	•	Real-world applications and future implications

 
Section 1: The Synergy of AI and Blockchain (7 minutes)
	1.	Why AI in Blockchain?
	•	Discuss the pain points in traditional blockchain systems (e.g., data handling, scalability, transaction security)
	•	Explain how AI adds value, through predictive analytics, smart contract optimization, fraud detection (or the ways you prefer to explain)
	2.	Andromeda’s Unique Approach to AI-Blockchain Integration
	•	Overview of Andromeda’s AI-driven solutions for data processing, decision-making, and ecosystem expansion (explain what you’re working on) 
Section 2: AI Applications in Andromeda’s Ecosystem (10 minutes)
	Emerging Tech Stack: apprise the class of the emerging standards in AI Engineering tools, which are blurring the lines between the technical and creative aspects of the Technology Creation Process.

	- Closed source engineering currently in use by Andromedans: AI Studio, Cursor, Warp, v0, CodeRabbit, CoPilot, and all the norms (chagGPT, Claude, Copilot “vanilla”) 

	- Open Source AI that I currently in use: LM Studio (chat and server), Ollama (server),

	
	2.	Smart Contract Optimization and Automation
	•	Demonstrate how AI helps create more efficient smart contracts that can optimize resource allocation and improve processing times
	•	Discuss potential impact on cross-chain interactions and interoperability
	
	•	Discuss how Andromeda’s AI contributions can set standards or inspire similar innovations in Web3 and other sectors 
Q&A and Closing (3 minutes)
	1.	Open the floor for a brief Q&A to answer audience questions.
	2. 	Closing remarks from Myron Koch, reinforcing the vision of AI-driven growth and  		innovation within Andromeda’s ecosystem.  		 Encourage attendees to engage further with Andromeda’s AI initiatives and explore opportunities to collaborate or build within the ecosystem.
	3.	Remind students about our Winternship program and opportunities for jobs with  		Andromeda for successful internship participants.
