## 🧠 Understanding AI Model Training & Model Sizes

### What Does It Mean to Train a Model?  
Training an AI model involves feeding it massive amounts of text, images, or other data so it can learn patterns, relationships, and context. The process includes:
- **Pretraining:** The model learns general knowledge from large datasets.
- **Fine-tuning:** The model is adjusted for specific tasks or domains.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Additional optimization methods, like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), improve its behavior.

### What Do Model Sizes Mean?  
AI models come in different sizes, typically measured in **parameters** (e.g., billions or trillions of values that help process and generate responses).  
- **Base Model:** The original model trained on general data before fine-tuning for specific tasks.  
- **Quantized Models:** Smaller, optimized versions of base models that reduce memory usage and improve efficiency (e.g., 4-bit or 8-bit quantization).  
  - Smaller quantized models run faster and take up less space but may lose some accuracy.

## WHAT ARE AGENTS?

An **agent** in artificial intelligence is an autonomous system that perceives its environment through sensors, processes this information, and takes actions via actuators to achieve specific goals. These agents operate independently, making decisions based on their perceptions and predefined objectives.  [oai_citation_attribution:0‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Key facets of AI agents include:

1. **Autonomy:** The ability to function without human intervention, controlling their actions and internal states independently.

2. **Reactivity:** The capacity to perceive and respond promptly to changes in the environment.

3. **Proactiveness:** The initiative to pursue goal-directed behavior by taking the necessary steps to achieve objectives.

4. **Social Ability:** The capability to interact with other agents or humans, often through communication or collaboration.

These facets enable AI agents to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple automated functions to complex decision-making processes, across various applications.

In about a week, these blows were cast:
- DeepSeek R1 chat model released. Blows away benchmarks, and the API costs 1/10 of chatGPT.
- Widespread press campaign claimed R1 had super-low production costs, and exhibited GPT o1 quality. 
- Result was market crash for all tech!
- R1 rumored to have Robotics training
- --> next, DeepSeek released "v3" chat model 
- Widespread press campaign claimed super-low production costs, and it exhibited GPT 4o quality. 
- --> next, "AGI BOT" demo released, claiming low production costs and "more human" movement than any competitor
- "AGI BOT" demo says DeepSeek R1 can be used in it for real-time decision making and complex problem solving 
- --> next, Alibaba announced Qwen 2.5 1M - which has a 1Mil token context window.... a direct affront to Google's Gemini models. 
- --> next, Alibaba announced Qwen 2.5-VL, which can control PCs and phones.... a direct affront to Claude's Computer Use. 

...and as a coincidence, Alibaba and Deepseek are headquartered in the same city, roughly 10-20 mins drive from each other. Probably nothing.
