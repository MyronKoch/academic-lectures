Good evening, everyone. I’m Myron, and it’s a pleasure to be here with you today. Let’s begin by exploring the concept of Agentic AI.
Agentic AI refers to systems capable of performing tasks autonomously, making decisions, and taking actions without human intervention. These AI agents can analyze data, learn from it, and execute actions to achieve specific goals, thereby streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.
In the financial sector, Agentic AI is revolutionizing operations by automating complex processes such as risk assessment, portfolio management, and algorithmic trading. For instance, AI agents can monitor market trends in real-time, execute trades based on predefined strategies, and adjust portfolios to optimize returns, all without manual oversight. This level of autonomy not only enhances efficiency but also reduces the potential for human error in high-stakes financial decisions.
Major financial institutions are actively integrating Agentic AI into their workflows. JPMorgan Chase, for example, has introduced a tool called LLM Suite that leverages generative AI to enhance productivity across various departments, including legal document processing and call centers. This integration has improved response times and accuracy, demonstrating the tangible benefits of AI-driven autonomy in finance.
The adoption of Agentic AI is not limited to large corporations. Open-source platforms like DeepSeek are making sophisticated AI technology more accessible, potentially democratizing tools that were once exclusive to high-frequency trading firms. This accessibility could reduce upfront costs and promote transparency in financial markets.
As we dive deeper into Agentic AI, we’ll examine its core concepts, historical development, and diverse applications within the financial industry. Understanding these elements will provide valuable insights into how AI-driven autonomy is shaping the future of finance.

WHAT ARE AGENTS?
An agent in artificial intelligence is an autonomous system that perceives its environment through sensors, processes this information, and takes actions via actuators to achieve specific goals. These agents operate independently, making decisions based on their perceptions and predefined objectives. oai_citation_attribution:0‡en.wikipedia.org
Key facets of AI agents include:
	•	Autonomy: The ability to function without human intervention, controlling their actions and internal states independently.
	•	Reactivity: The capacity to perceive and respond promptly to changes in the environment.
	•	Proactiveness: The initiative to pursue goal-directed behavior by taking the necessary steps to achieve objectives.
	•	Social Ability: The capability to interact with other agents or humans, often through communication or collaboration.
These facets enable AI agents to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple automated functions to complex decision-making processes, across various applications.

—   Let’s get into the landscape of agentic workflows, exploring platforms that cater to various levels of technical expertise—from no-code solutions to advanced code-based frameworks.
And I want to be direct with you about something: Pretty soon, you're not going to have to write a single line of code.

*[The room gasped. An audible gasp from a packed room of CS students. Then everyone started talking to each other - they couldn't believe it. I rattled them.]*

I'm serious. The direction this is heading - the combination of reasoning models and agentic frameworks - means the role of the developer is fundamentally changing. Let me show you what I mean.

	Now let’s dive into the cutting-edge landscape of AI models with you tonight. We’re going to explore several of the industry’s most influential platforms and understand their unique strengths and strategic differences.
Let’s jump right in with Anthropic’s Claude series.
[SECTION 1: Anthropic Claude Models]
	Anthropic has introduced multiple versions of Claude, each optimized for different scenarios:
	First up is Claude Opus.
This is their most powerful, premium-tier model. Opus is built to handle extremely complex tasks with exceptional depth. It offers context windows of up to 200,000 tokens by default, and even up to one million tokens for specialized uses, making it perfect for deep analytical work and extensive document processing.
	Next, we have Claude Sonnet 3.5.
Released last summer, Sonnet 3.5 builds on the Opus model by adding a really interesting feature called “Artifacts.” This lets the model generate real-time interactive outputs, like writing live code or previewing fully rendered web pages and graphics right in your workflow.
	Just released recently is Claude Sonnet 3.7.
Sonnet 3.7 introduces adaptive reasoning—it can shift dynamically between quick intuitive responses and deeper, step-by-step reasoning depending on what you need. This flexibility allows users to balance response speed and detailed analysis seamlessly.
	Lastly, there’s Claude Haiku.
Haiku is Anthropic’s lightweight model. Version 3.5, released last October, delivers surprisingly powerful coding capabilities while remaining budget-friendly. Haiku is great when cost-efficiency is key without compromising too heavily on quality.
	All Claude models share multimodal capabilities (handling text and images), yet differ significantly in complexity, performance, and cost—allowing you to choose precisely what fits your use-case.
[SECTION 2: OpenAI’s GPT Models]
	Now let’s shift gears and talk about OpenAI’s latest offerings, starting with GPT-4o.
Released last May, GPT-4o is a multimodal powerhouse. It not only processes text and images but also audio. GPT-4o currently holds industry-leading benchmarks in voice recognition, translation, and multimedia comprehension—making it ideal for advanced interactive applications.
	Then there’s GPT-4.5.
This brand-new model, launched just last month, might be OpenAI’s final purely generative model before fully embracing new reasoning architectures. GPT-4.5 specializes in nuanced, human-like interaction—capturing emotional intelligence, subtlety, and conversational depth, ideal for customer service or empathetic engagement scenarios.
	OpenAI also introduced specialized reasoning-focused models, o1 and o3.
o1 was developed explicitly to prioritize deep logic and accuracy, excelling in science and coding tasks. Its successor, o3, expands this reasoning approach further, with two versions: o3-mini, optimized for fast, efficient reasoning, and o3-mini-high, focusing on extensive, rigorous thought processes for complex analytical tasks.
	While all GPT models share exceptional generative abilities, they differ notably in reasoning depth, multimodal functionality, and computational requirements.
[SECTION 3: DeepSeek R1 Comparison]
	Finally, let’s quickly look at DeepSeek R1, an interesting competitor positioned uniquely in the AI landscape.
DeepSeek R1 provides strong reasoning capabilities, similar to OpenAI’s o-series, but does so at a much more affordable cost. Its focus on efficiency without significantly sacrificing quality makes it especially appealing for projects that need powerful reasoning capabilities on a tighter budget.
[SUMMARY & KEY DIFFERENTIATORS]
	So, to sum it all up clearly:
		•	Claude emphasizes scalability and flexibility, offering distinct models tailored to varied complexity and cost needs.
	•	GPT models lead in multimodal capabilities, intuitive interaction, and nuanced communication.
	•	DeepSeek R1 positions itself strategically as a cost-effective, yet powerful reasoning-oriented alternative.
	Selecting the right model is about matching your specific needs—whether cost, performance, reasoning depth, or multimodal capabilities—to what each of these cutting-edge platforms has to offer.
